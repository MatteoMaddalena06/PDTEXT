# PDTEXT
PDTEX(Programming DOS text editor)si a simple and minimal text editor for MS-DOS environments.
Designed for an Intel processor with 16-bit x86 architecture, it is also compatible with modern processors, unfortunately the operating system will not allow you to run programs in real mod, for this it is highly recommended to use an MS-DOS environment emulator.
It was developed completely in assembly, working in real mode, it relies only on the services of the BIOS that has become so universal on all compatible IBM computers.
